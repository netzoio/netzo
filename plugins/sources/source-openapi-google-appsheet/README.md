An open-source source plugin for AppSheet apps and data tables.

Google AppSheet is a widespread low-code application development system that connects to your Google Workspace apps.

During the Service configuration, you will require a Google AppSheet `ApplicationAccessKey`.

If you are an Admin, you may find your keys by navigating to `Manage > Integration > IN: from cloud services to your app`

Here you will find your:

- `AppId`
- `ApplicationAccessKey`

You will also require:

- `tableName`: You may find available tableNames by navigating to `Data`

#### Important

- Be sure to pass tableNames in URLencoded format, e.g `"my Table" = "my%20Table"`
- `tableNames` are also case-sensitive
