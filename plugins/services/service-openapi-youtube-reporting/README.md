An open-source service plugin for YouTube Reporting.

The **YouTube Reporting API** retrieves **bulk reports** containing YouTube Analytics data for a channel or content owner. It is designed for applications that can import large data sets and that provide tools to filter, sort, and mine that data.

Each report contains a predefined set of fields. Developers use the API to schedule reporting jobs, each of which identifies a report that YouTube should generate. YouTube then generates a daily report that can be asynchronously downloaded. Each report contains data for a unique 24-hour period.
